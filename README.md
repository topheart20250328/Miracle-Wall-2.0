# Project Requirements & Guidelines

## 📱 Mobile & Cross-Platform Compatibility (CRITICAL)
**All changes and features must be tested and verified for:**
- **LINE In-App Browser** (iOS & Android)
- **Mobile Safari** (iOS)
- **Chrome for Android**
- **Various Screen Sizes** (Responsive Design)

**Key Considerations:**
- Touch events (single/multi-touch handling)
- Viewport scaling and resizing behavior
- CSS compatibility (flexbox, grid, safe-area-inset)
- Performance on lower-end mobile devices
- Prevention of "pull-to-refresh" or native gestures interfering with app logic
